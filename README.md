This app allows users to set up name, display format and email for Hands On Essentials badges. This app also allows users to create links between the Snowflake Trial Accounts they use for Essentials Lab work and their learn.snowflake.com learning. Finally, users can check their progress toward receiving various Essentials badges by viewing their DORA test results.
